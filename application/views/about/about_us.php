        <h2>Al-KHWARIZMI CUP AUTOMATED SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the AL-KHWARIZMI CUP Automated System, the system behind the annual intramurals that have been uniting students since 2010. Our mission is to promote camaraderie, foster lasting bonds, and provide a platform for our students to showcase their talents.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>AL-KHWARIZMI CUP, an annual event with four competing houses, with the aim of creating a sense of community and friendly competition. Over the years, it has grown into a much-anticipated tradition at our institution.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
        <p>Mohammad Amr P. Pangandaman is the developer behind this automated system. This project was developed as a requirement for the Bachelor of Science in Information course. His dedication to enhancing the intramural experience led to the creation of a unique and user-friendly platform.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We aspire to achieve a smoother intramural experience for both our participants and spectators. With our automated system, we aim to streamline the management of the AL-KHWARIZMI CUP, making it more accessible, enjoyable, and efficient for everyone involved.</p>
